# Content-Based Music Recommendation System
This project implements a content-based music recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system recommends 5 similar songs based on features such as genre, tempo, energy, danceability and other music-related attributes. It supports Euclidean distance and Cosine similarity for measuring song resemblance and provides a simple Gradio interface for user interaction. The project aims to offer personalized music recommendations based on the characteristics of songs in the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features of songs, such as genre, tempo, danceability, energy and more. Available through the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs?select=spotify_songs.csv)
